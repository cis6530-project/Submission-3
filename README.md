This is the GitHub SUBMISSION 3 Repository for the Fall 2025 project of CIS6530 - Cyber Threat Intelligence and Adversarial Risk Analysis of the MCTI at the University of Guelph.

NOTE TO THE TA: 
Our previous submission 2 contained 322 executables. In order to represent our updated dataset of 630 executables, we also have again attached Exeutables folder.
-Opcodes
-Custom Script
-Read me (for script instructions)

*** We were able to extract the opcodes for most of the files (400 opcodes) but the other 200 take a lot of time for the script to extrct. We are looking into this and working to extract the other 200 opcodes for our work for Submission 4 and Submission 5.
DUE TO TIME CONSTRAINTS, we have submitted the 400 opcodes.
